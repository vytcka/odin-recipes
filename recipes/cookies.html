    <h1>Chocolate Shortbread Cookies</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chocolaty shortbread cookies are great little cookies on their own; but are very versatile, too. You can
        decorate them with powdered sugar, melted chocolate, or royal icingâ€”or fill them with frosting, ganache, or
        caramel to make sandwich cookies. The possibilities are endless!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant espresso powder (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sift together 2 cups plus 1 tablespoon flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and salt; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy; beat in vanilla. Add
            dry ingredients in 3 separate additions, mixing until just combined after each addition, until a thick dough
            forms. Flatten dough into a large disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill dough in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line 2 large cookie sheets with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove dough from fridge and roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out
            shapes using cookie cutters. Knead any dough scraps back together, re-roll, and cut out more cookies as
            needed. Place cutouts 1 inch apart on the lined baking sheets, and refrigerate for about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake cookies in the preheated oven, 1 baking sheet at a time, until cookies are just set, about 10 minutes.
            Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>
