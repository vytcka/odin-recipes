    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano, undrained</li>
        <li>1 cup SwansonÂ® Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>4 ounces uncooked penne pasta</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Season the chicken as desired. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and
            cook until well browned, stirring often. Remove the chicken from the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the onion to the skillet and cook until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Add the wine and heat to a
            boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the tomatoes, Swanson Chicken Broth, penne, and water; heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium.
            Cook for 10 minutes or until the penne is tender, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to the skillet.
            Cook for 2 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the spinach and cook for 1 minute or
            until the spinach is wilted.
        </li>
    </ol>
